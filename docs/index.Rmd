## Objectives  
1. Recognize the components of interactive assessment reports as constructed at Ferris;
1. Locate and use the online tools necessary to create interactive assessment reports;
1. Appreciate the costs and benefits of interactive assessment reports;
1. Be prepared to use these employ these reports on their own campuses.

## Reproducible assessment
<blockquote>Our goal is to create reproducible processes to increase transparency and <em>encourage faculty engagement</em>.</blockquote>  

* **ALL** assessment resources are public-facing  <br />  

	* Data reports (PDF and HTML)
	* Data analysis code (R)
	* Deidentified data files (csv)<br />

* All released with MIT or CC-BY licenses  
* All results are computationally reproducible and extensible

## An Example of Indirect Assessment
* Graduate Survey Results  
* Sent to all graduating seniors  
* Both quantitative and qualitative data

## Standardize: Measures
* Created in order to get more uniform data collection and summarization

>* 14 different type of measures are defined  
>* Instructors can choose to use any one they wish <br /><br />  

>1. Exams
>2. Products
>3. Performances

## Standardize: Registering Courses
* I need to know who is doing what each semester

>* Who is collecting data?
>* What competency is being measured?
>* What outcome is being measured?
>* What measure is being used?
>* All tracked using a Google form

## Standarize: Data Collection
* <a href="https://ferris.edu/HTMLS/academics/general-education/procedures/forms/workbooks/index.htm", target="_blank">This is the biggest step forward for us</a>

>* Excel workbooks to collect and summarize student results
>* SCORE, PREPOST, NORM, RUBRIC
>* Common metadata supplied by instructors
>* Enter student names, IDs, and appropriate evaluations
>* A standaridized summary is automatically generated

## Standardize: TracDat Assignments
* Seeking to minimize the need for faculty to log into TracDat

>* Received as an email
>* Copy and paste summary
>* Select a few responses from drop-down menus
>* Add a short reflection
>* Attach the workbook and submit

## Automate: Analysis of Student Data
* All workbooks are stored in the TracDat document repository

>* Each semester's data is in a separate folder
>* Download all the workbooks
>* An R script is used to process the workbooks
>* All data is aggregated into one csv file
>* Identifiable information is removed

## Automate: Reporting

>* Using R and bookdown (Rmarkdown)  
>* Reuseable, version-controlled code  
>* PDF reports for printing  
>* HTML reports for distribution and collaboration  

## Assessment in Action
* **Five means of creating a dialog:** <br /><br />  

>1. <a href="http://www.reproducibleassessment.com/1601/report-1601.pdf", target="_blank">Print reports for dissemination</a>  
>2. <a href="http://www.reproducibleassessment.com/1601/", target="_blank">Online forums for extended discussions</a>  
>3. <a href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/35GSR", target="_blank">OSF projects as the ultimate home base</a>  
>4. <a href="http://github.com/weebeasties/1601_SCI1", target="_blank">GitHub repositories for reproducibility</a>  
>5. <a href="https://weebeasties.shinyapps.io/Dashboard", target="_blank">Executive dashboard for overviews</a>  

## Summary

>* We are creating a _collaborative_ assessment environment  
>* This is more about **process** than **personality**  
>* Focus is on making a **resource** rather than just **reports**
